# Gateway-Worker Integration Validation Checklist

This checklist validates the integration between Gateway and Worker services according to the architecture described in [WORKER-PURPOSE.md](WORKER-PURPOSE.md).

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Gateway service builds successfully (`cargo build --bin gateway`)
- [ ] Worker service builds successfully (`cargo build --bin gateway-worker`)
- [ ] PostgreSQL database is available for Worker service
- [ ] Redis instance is available for job queue and caching
- [ ] Network connectivity between Gateway and Worker services

## Phase 1: Basic Communication

### gRPC Infrastructure
- [ ] gRPC protocol buffer definitions compile successfully
- [ ] Worker service starts and listens on gRPC port (default: 50051)
- [ ] Gateway service can connect to Worker gRPC endpoint
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] mTLS authentication works when enabled

### Service Discovery
- [ ] Worker service registers successfully
- [ ] Gateway service discovers Worker service
- [ ] Connection failover works when Worker is unavailable
- [ ] Connection recovery works when Worker comes back online

## Phase 2: Certificate Management

### Certificate Operations
- [ ] Gateway can request certificates from Worker
- [ ] Worker can provide existing certificates to Gateway
- [ ] Worker can generate temporary certificates when needed
- [ ] Certificate updates are pushed to Gateway via gRPC stream
- [ ] Gateway hot-reloads certificates without downtime

### Certificate Renewal
- [ ] Worker monitors certificate expiration dates
- [ ] Worker initiates renewal process before expiration
- [ ] ACME protocol integration works correctly
- [ ] Temporary certificates are deployed when renewal fails
- [ ] Real certificates replace temporary ones after successful renewal

### Certificate Validation
- [ ] Certificate validation works correctly
- [ ] Certificate chain validation passes
- [ ] Expired certificates are detected and handled
- [ ] Invalid certificates are rejected
- [ ] Certificate storage and retrieval works

## Phase 3: Configuration Management

### Configuration Operations
- [ ] Gateway can request configurations from Worker
- [ ] Worker provides WAF rules to Gateway
- [ ] Worker provides routing configuration to Gateway
- [ ] Configuration updates are pushed to Gateway via gRPC stream
- [ ] Gateway applies configuration changes without restart

### Configuration Validation
- [ ] WAF rule validation works correctly
- [ ] ModSecurity rule syntax is validated
- [ ] Invalid configurations are rejected
- [ ] Configuration rollback works when needed
- [ ] Configuration versioning is maintained

### Real-time Updates
- [ ] Configuration changes are applied immediately
- [ ] Multiple Gateway instances receive updates
- [ ] Configuration consistency across instances
- [ ] No request loss during configuration updates
- [ ] Audit trail for configuration changes is maintained

## Phase 4: Log Processing

### Log Streaming
- [ ] Gateway streams logs to Worker service
- [ ] Different log types are handled correctly (access, security, performance)
- [ ] Log buffering and batching works efficiently
- [ ] No log loss during network issues
- [ ] Log compression works when enabled

### Log Processing
- [ ] Worker processes access logs correctly
- [ ] Security logs trigger appropriate analysis
- [ ] Performance logs update metrics
- [ ] Log aggregation works across multiple Gateway instances
- [ ] Log archival and cleanup works

### Analytics and Reporting
- [ ] Real-time metrics are generated correctly
- [ ] Security event correlation works
- [ ] Performance analytics are accurate
- [ ] Dashboard data is updated in real-time
- [ ] Historical data is preserved

## Phase 5: Performance and Reliability

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Gateway response times remain under SLA (< 10ms overhead)
- [ ] Worker operations don't affect Gateway performance
- [ ] gRPC communication overhead is minimal
- [ ] Memory usage is within acceptable limits
- [ ] CPU usage is within acceptable limits

### Reliability Testing
- [ ] Gateway continues operating when Worker is down
- [ ] Worker recovery doesn't disrupt Gateway operations
- [ ] Certificate expiration doesn't cause service outage
- [ ] Configuration errors don't crash services
- [ ] Log processing failures don't affect Gateway

### Failover Scenarios
- [ ] Worker service restart works seamlessly
- [ ] Database connectivity issues are handled gracefully
- [ ] Redis connectivity issues are handled gracefully
- [ ] Network partitions are handled correctly
- [ ] Partial service degradation works as expected

## Phase 6: Security Validation

### Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] mTLS authentication works correctly
- [ ] Service-to-service authorization works
- [ ] Certificate-based authentication is secure
- [ ] Access logs include authentication events
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are logged

### Network Security
- [ ] gRPC communication is encrypted
- [ ] Network segmentation works correctly
- [ ] Firewall rules are properly configured
- [ ] No sensitive data is logged in plain text
- [ ] Certificate storage is secure

### Security Monitoring
- [ ] Security events are detected and logged
- [ ] Suspicious patterns trigger alerts
- [ ] Attack correlation works correctly
- [ ] Automatic response rules work
- [ ] Security metrics are updated

## Phase 7: Operational Validation

### Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Health checks work for both services
- [ ] Metrics are exposed correctly
- [ ] Logging is working and structured
- [ ] Tracing spans are created correctly
- [ ] Alerting rules are functional

### Deployment and Scaling
- [ ] Service deployment works correctly
- [ ] Rolling updates work without downtime
- [ ] Horizontal scaling works for both services
- [ ] Load balancing works correctly
- [ ] Resource limits are enforced

### Backup and Recovery
- [ ] Database backups are working
- [ ] Certificate backups are working
- [ ] Configuration backups are working
- [ ] Recovery procedures work correctly
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan is validated

## Final Validation

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Complete request flow works correctly
- [ ] Certificate renewal during traffic works
- [ ] Configuration updates during traffic work
- [ ] Security events are handled correctly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements

### Production Readiness
- [ ] All documentation is updated
- [ ] Runbooks are created and tested
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards are configured
- [ ] Alert rules are configured and tested
- [ ] Team training is completed

## Validation Commands

```bash
