# Worker Service Architecture - Separation of Responsibilities

This document describes the architectural evolution of Gateway from a monolithic service to a two-service architecture, separating real-time proxy operations from asynchronous background tasks.

## Overview

The current Gateway implementation is a high-performance, monolithic service that handles all aspects of API gateway functionality. As the system scales and complexity increases, there's a clear benefit to separating concerns between real-time proxy operations and background asynchronous tasks.

The proposed architecture introduces a **Worker Service** that operates alongside the main **Gateway Service**, each with distinct responsibilities and operational characteristics.

## Service Responsibilities

### Gateway Service

The Gateway Service remains focused exclusively on **real-time, high-performance proxy operations** and immediate security enforcement:

#### Core Responsibilities
- **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy**: High-performance request/response proxying with Pingora integration
- **Protocol Support**: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, gRPC, WebSocket termination and forwarding
- **Load Balancing**: Real-time backend selection with health checks and circuit breakers
- **Request Routing**: URL-based routing, header-based routing, and content-based routing
- **Real-time Security (WAF)**:
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS protection
  - CSRF prevention
  - Directory traversal prevention
  - Malicious payload detection
- **Rate Limiting**: Distributed rate limiting with immediate enforcement
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT validation, OAuth2 token validation, RBAC enforcement
- **TLS Termination**: SSL/TLS connection handling and certificate serving
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling, keep-alive, connection reuse
- **Request/Response Transformation**: Headers manipulation, payload transformation
- **Circuit Breakers**: Immediate failure detection and traffic management

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Ultra-low latency**: Single-digit millisecond response times
- **High throughput**: Thousands of requests per second per instance
- **Memory efficiency**: Minimal memory footprint for request processing
- **CPU optimization**: Optimized for request/response processing
- **Stateless operation**: No persistent state beyond active connections

### Worker Service

The Worker Service handles **asynchronous, background tasks** that don't require immediate response times but are critical for system operation:

#### Core Responsibilities
- **Certificate Management**:
  - Automatic certificate renewal via ACME protocol (Let's Encrypt, etc.)
  - Certificate validation and health monitoring
  - Certificate distribution to Gateway instances
  - Certificate backup and recovery
- **Configuration Management**:
  - WAF rule updates and compilation
  - Routing configuration updates
  - Backend health check configuration
  - Security policy updates
- **Log Processing**:
  - Access log aggregation and processing
  - Security event correlation
  - Audit trail generation
  - Log compression and archival
- **Analytics & Monitoring**:
  - Traffic pattern analysis
  - Performance metrics aggregation
  - Security threat intelligence processing
  - Capacity planning data generation
- **Database Operations**:
  - Database schema migrations
  - Data cleanup and archival
  - Backup operations
  - Performance optimization tasks
- **Integration Tasks**:
  - External API integrations
  - Third-party security feed processing
  - Notification and alerting
  - Report generation

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Batch processing**: Optimized for throughput over latency
- **Resource intensive**: Can use more CPU and memory for complex operations
- **Persistent state**: Maintains job queues, schedules, and processing state
- **Fault tolerant**: Retry mechanisms, job persistence, failure recovery

## Certificate Management Flow

One of the most critical integrations between Gateway and Worker services is certificate management, particularly the ability to serve temporary certificates while real certificates are being renewed.

### Normal Operation Flow

```
1. Worker monitors certificate expiration dates
2. Worker initiates renewal process 30 days before expiration
3. Worker requests new certificate from CA (ACME protocol)
4. Worker validates new certificate
5. Worker updates certificate store
6. Worker notifies Gateway of new certificate availability
7. Gateway loads new certificate and begins using it
8. Old certificate is marked for cleanup after grace period
```

### Temporary Certificate Flow

In scenarios where certificate renewal fails or takes longer than expected:

```
1. Worker detects certificate renewal failure or delay
2. Worker generates temporary self-signed certificate with:
   - Same subject name as original certificate
   - Extended validity period (7-30 days)
   - Clear marking as temporary certificate
3. Worker immediately deploys temporary certificate to Gateway
4. Gateway begins serving temporary certificate
5. Worker continues renewal attempts in background
6. Once real certificate is obtained, Worker replaces temporary certificate
7. Gateway automatically switches to real certificate
8. Temporary certificate is cleaned up
```

### Certificate Distribution

```
Gateway Instance 1  ←─┐
Gateway Instance 2  ←─┼─── Worker Service (Certificate Manager)
Gateway Instance 3  ←─┘         │
                                ├─── Certificate Store (Redis/Database)
                                ├─── ACME Client (Let's Encrypt)
                                └─── Certificate Validation Engine
```

## Expected Flows and Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Traffic WAF Rule Update

**Current Monolithic Approach:**
- Admin updates WAF rule via API
- Gateway immediately compiles and applies rule
- Risk of performance impact during rule compilation
- Potential for service disruption if rule is invalid

**New Two-Service Approach:**
```
1. Admin updates WAF rule via Worker API
2. Worker validates rule syntax and logic
3. Worker compiles rule in background
4. Worker tests rule against historical traffic patterns
5. Worker stages compiled rule for deployment
6. Worker pushes validated rule to Gateway instances
7. Gateway hot-swaps rule without service interruption
8. Worker monitors rule performance and effectiveness
```

### Scenario 2: Certificate Renewal During Peak Traffic

**Current Risk:**
- Certificate renewal process could impact Gateway performance
- Manual intervention required if renewal fails
- Service disruption if certificate expires

**New Two-Service Flow:**
```
1. Worker detects upcoming certificate expiration (30 days out)
2. Worker begins renewal process during low-traffic period
3. Worker obtains new certificate from CA
4. Worker validates certificate against current domains
5. Worker deploys certificate to Gateway instances with zero downtime
6. Worker monitors certificate deployment success
7. If renewal fails, Worker deploys temporary certificate automatically
8. Worker alerts administrators and continues renewal attempts
```

### Scenario 3: Security Incident Response

**Current Limitations:**
- Security rules must be applied manually
- Limited ability to analyze attack patterns in real-time
- Reactive rather than proactive response

**New Two-Service Approach:**
```
1. Gateway detects suspicious traffic patterns
2. Gateway logs security events to Worker
3. Worker correlates events across all Gateway instances
4. Worker identifies coordinated attack patterns
5. Worker generates new WAF rules automatically
6. Worker deploys emergency rules to all Gateway instances
7. Worker continues analysis for long-term security improvements
8. Worker generates incident reports and recommendations
```

## Benefits of Service Decoupling
